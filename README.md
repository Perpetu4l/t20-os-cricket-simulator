#  T20 Cricket Simulator (OS-Based Project)

A multi-threaded T20 cricket simulator built to demonstrate core **Operating System concepts** such as scheduling, synchronization, concurrency, and deadlock handling through a realistic cricket match environment.

---

##  Overview

This project models a T20 cricket match where different components (players, match engine, logging system) execute concurrently using threads. It simulates ball-by-ball gameplay while ensuring safe access to shared resources.

---

##  Features

- Ball-by-ball T20 match simulation  
- Multi-threaded architecture  
- Custom scheduling mechanism  
- Synchronization using mutex/semaphores  
- Deadlock detection and resolution  
- Detailed logging system  
- Gantt chart visualization of execution  
- Match statistics and scorecard generation
